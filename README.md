# Joplin Bible Notes Plugin

This plugin scans your notes to find where you specified a Bible reference.

## Why ?

As I realized I had a lot of notes referencing Bible verses and passages, I wanted an easy way to find where in my notes I mentioned a particular Book or verse of the Bible. Yeah, the search function could have done it, but it didn't give me an overall view in the Bible of what I have already treated and what not.
